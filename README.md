# Flexgrid - a simple grid based on flexbox layout

No more floats! Regular grid layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, however, the flexbox (or just flex) layout is based on "flex-flow directions". Thus `float` and `clear` have no effect. Using `float` causes the `display`-property to compute to `block`. Using `flexbox` also means less JavaScript! Everything is, of course, responsive and stacks perfectly.

**Please note:** Flexbox is only partially supported by IE10. Any IE-version lower than 10 does not support flexbox. However, Flexgrid has many fallbacks included, so IE11 is safe. More info [here].

Flexgrid is an integral part of the upcoming [Nano Framework](https://github.com/getnano/nano-framework), where Flexgrid is the standard grid-system and provides a stable flexbox skeleton.

### Classes
Flexgrid now has 5 classes, compared to 4 in v1. You might find these familiar, as these resemble [Bootstrap]:
- xs (xtra small - for mobile devices and small tablets)
- sm (small - for large mobile devices and tablets)
- md (medium - for tablets and very small laptops)
- lg (large - for smaller laptops and -desktops)
- xl (xlarge - for desktops)

The classes can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.

**Pro tip**: Each class scales up, so if you wish to set the same widths for 'sm' and 'md', you only need to specify 'sm'.

### .container and .container-fluid
Flexgrid comes with responsive containers that boxes the content in which are controlled by `@media`-queries. These `@media`-queries trigger at the same widths defined by the [Bootstrap]-framework. However, as a small detail, Flexgrid bases its width-triggers on `rem` instead of `px`. This creates a much more fluid layout. While `em` is relative to the `font-size` of its direct or nearest parent, `rem` is only relative to the `html` (root) `font-size`. Flexgrid `font-size` is set to `16px`. There is also a fluid container that has no `@media`-queries.

### Columns
Flexgrid comes with columns with percent-based widths allow fluid resizing of columns and rows.

### Offsets
It's fairly easy to offset columns

### Auto width
This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.

### Justifying content
##### space-around:
With `space-around`, items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them.
##### space-between:
`space-between` distributes items in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line.
##### start, end, center
- `start`: (default): items are packed toward the start line.
- `center`: tems are centered along the line.
- `end`: items are packed toward to end line.

##### top, middle, bottom
Vertically aligning items can be a pain. But not with `flexbox`.

### Ordering
By default, items are laid out in the source order. However, the `order`-property controls the order in which they appear in the container.

### Reversing
Reversing is basically the same as `direction: rtl`, just smarter. You no longer have to reverse the `direction` inside the item for text to align properly.

#### Demonstration of all these can be found via the demo link!

### Editing the source
It's easy to modify the source. Clone this repository or download the release, and edit away.
Flexgrid comes with a `gulpfile` that can compile the source for you. To install its dependencies, you need to have **NodeJS** and `npm` installed.
To install the gulp dependencies, you just run:
```
npm install
```

When you're done editing, you just run:
```
gulp scss
```
If you want to minify the CSS, you can run:
```
gulp css-ugly
```
